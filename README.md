## Description

_This application will use the OpenWeather API to find current weather conditions based on user input._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository to your Desktop_
* _Install Node._
* _Type the command 'npm install' into your command line. This will install the technologies needed by the dev environment._
* _Use the command 'npm run build' to build your project._
* _Use the command 'npm run start' to build your project and start a live server._
* _Use the command 'npm run lint' to use ESLint on your project._
* _Use the command 'npm run test' to use Jest to test your logic. You will need to set up a `__tests__` directory in the top level of your project with files for each test suite you would like to run. These suites will utilize import and export statements to link the js files you would like to test._
* _You will need to get an API key from OpenWeather API to submit a "GET" request. To get a key, visit [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/appid) and set up a free account and they will send one via email after verifying your email. Please note that the key may take a couple of hours to activate._
* _Add '.env' to your '.gitignore' file. and push to your repo in order to make sure your key is secure._
* _Create a file called '.env' and add your key to the file with the format "API_KEY='YOUR_KEY'"._
* _After using the command 'npm run start', interact with the webpage._


## Known Bugs

* _In some cases, npm may not function properly. To fix this, you will need to install a node version manager to find a version of Node that works. I used version 16.14.0_
